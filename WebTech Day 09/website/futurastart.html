<h1>Behind The Font: <br>Why The Futura Typeface Never Looks Dated</h1>

<h4>We all love unique, artsy fonts. Designers’ font collections may be stuffed with statement fonts — ranging from retro to futuristic, grungy to alarmingly elegant, baroque to Bauhaus-inspired. But even the most eclectic font collection isn’t complete without a couple hits. There are certain fonts that designers reach for time after time, like the endless variations of Helvetica, DIN, and of course, the Futura typeface.</h4>

<h4>We’re dedicating this article to one of the most common staples of our customers’ font libraries; a typeface that’s graced countless logos; a formidable font that looks just as modern today as it did when it was first released in 1927; the one and only Futura.</h4>

<h2>A Brief History Of Futura</h2>
<p>German type designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Renner">Paul Renner</a> began work on the Futura typeface in 1924 as a contribution to the New Frankfurt project (an affordable housing project which drew support and design contribution from many esteemed architects). Futura was released by The Bauer Type Foundry in 1927. It was marketed as the “font of our time,” and also as the “font of the future.” It was an immediate commercial success.</p>

<p>Many people might view Futura’s clean lines and instinctively label the typeface as Bauhaus design, but Renner himself was more closely associated with the <a href="http://www.designhistory.org/Avant_Garde_pages/DieNeueType.html">New Typography Movement</a>, which slightly predated Bauhaus. While the two schools of thought definitely influenced one another, they remained distinct.</p>

<p>While Futura was received well on the global stage, it was met with resistance in its native country. Renner himself was outspoken about his disapproval of the Nazi party, eventually leading to his arrest, dismissal, and temporary relocation to Switzerland.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the Nazi party’s rise to power, they staunchly rejected the more modern, Roman typefaces in favor of traditional Blackletter type. Futura’s clean, elegant anatomy resulted in the typeface being cited by the Nazis as an example of “degenerate art.”</p>

<p>The Nazi party clung to the antiquated Blackletter type while the rest of Europe (including occupied territories) and the Allied Forces opted for cleaner, more readable typefaces. In 1941, the Nazi party finally surrendered to popular opinion (and legibility concerns) and switched gears dramatically. They falsely claimed that Blackletter had Jewish roots and banned it, making a clear statement that Roman style typography was to be the new norm in Germany. But it was too late for the Nazis to capitalize on Futura’s popularity — it already had taken on a life of its own.</p>

<p>Shortly after its debut, the world started seeing Futura in graphs, charts, maps, comic strips, and print advertising. It was the perfect no-nonsense font for presenting information and complementing images. The Futura typeface spawned countless imitations, but none of them caught on quite like the original. From brands to fine art, Futura has been a true workhorse of typeface for nearly a century. It was even used on the sides of NASA rockets and is featured on the plaque left on the moon by Apollo 11 astronauts.</p>

<p>You read that right. There’s Futura on the moon. We can’t imagine that Josef Renner ever saw that coming.</p>


<h3>Futura In Logos, Advertising, And Art</h3>

<p>If it’s good enough for astronauts, it’s good enough for adventurers working a bit closer to home. The Futura typeface has been employed by two of the most popular automobile companies in the world — Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen. While both auto manufacturers are German, they have wildly different brands. Mercedes Benz is associated with luxury and precision, while Volkswagen has long been viewed as an alternative to a luxury car; reliable but affordable, with a bit of counter-culture clout. Yet, both brands used Futura because the typeface is wildly versatile.</p>

<p>This versatility is the reason that you’ll spot Futura logos across a wide variety of brands. Just because a neutral, minimal fashion line like Calvin Klein uses it, doesn’t mean it’s not a perfect fit for a more extravagant fashion brand like Dolce & Gabbana, or a streetwear brand like Supreme, or a sports brand like Nike.</p>

<p>The entertainment industry adores Futura. This font was also thought to be Stanley Kubrick’s favorite typeface, and he used it in the posters and title cards for 2001: A Space Odyssey and Eyes Wide Shut. Director Wes Anderson’s has used it for many of his films, and it even graces set design throughout The Royal Tenenbaums. You may have also seen it gracing the title cards and posters for American Beauty, Gravity, Interstellar, and V for Vendetta, to name a few.</p>
 

<p>It’s been also used by hospitals, hotels, banks, book publishers, a certain Swedish furniture manufacturer, and a certain Swedish vodka. Here are fifteen of the most recognizable logos using Futura.</p>
